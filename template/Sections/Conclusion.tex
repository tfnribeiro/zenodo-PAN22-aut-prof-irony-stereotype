We tackled the challenge of detecting irony and stereotype spreaders by focusing on creating stylistic and lexical features. We compared the performance of our features with the suggest baseline for the task, a 4-char gram model followed by an SVM, with our own features. Our features combined with a random forest classifier outperform the baseline by $\approx 11\%$ on a $30\%$ split of the training data. We also obtained $95.56\%$ accuracy on the task's test set, by using a random forest classifier with our features. We can see room for improvement to focus on identifying passages for irony and sarcasm usage and develop features which focus on encoding context and semantic relationship between words.
