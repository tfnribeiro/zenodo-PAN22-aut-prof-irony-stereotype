\subsection{Q1}
% Q1.Explain the difference between irony and stereotype. Based on this difference, discuss whether the users in the datasets consistently display both, or whether they tend to either spread irony or stereotypical views. Can you observe any general pattern of the relation between the two behaviours in the dataset?

Cambridge dictionary defines stereotype as: "a set idea that people have about what someone or something is like, especially an idea that is wrong.".

We have 4 different examples:
- Irony towards a minority group
- General Irony
- Spreading Stereotypes
